This is a fork of the repository used by the Foundation to build kernel and
firmware packages for the Raspberry Pi: https://github.com/RPi-Distro/firmware

We use it to build kernels for the Revolution Pi and are providing it here
as a service to our users to allow building custom kernels.  The resulting
deb packages serve as drop-in replacements for the Foundation's packages.
Installation with deb packages is cleaner than just copying the kernel and
modules to the bare filesystem.

Unfortunately the Foundation's repo is huge (currently 5 GByte) as it includes
all their kernels and modules in binary form dating back to 2012.  That's why
this repo was stripped of the git history as well as files which can be rebuilt
from the kernel source tree.

Intended usage:
    apt-get install device-tree-compiler
    apt-get install gcc-arm-linux-gnueabihf
    apt-get install build-essential:native debhelper quilt
    git clone -b revpi-4.19 https://github.com/RevolutionPi/linux
    git clone https://github.com/RevolutionPi/piControl
    git clone https://github.com/RevolutionPi/kernelbakery
    cd kernelbakery
    LINUXDIR=$PWD/../linux PIKERNELMODDIR=$PWD/../piControl debian/update.sh
    dpkg-buildpackage -a armhf -b -us -uc

This procedure was tested successfully on Debian buster amd64, but YMMV.
Building the kernel with update.sh is idempotent.  If it fails, e.g. due to
compiler errors in piControl, just start it afresh.
